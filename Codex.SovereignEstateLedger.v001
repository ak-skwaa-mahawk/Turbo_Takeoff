This React component is the canonical visual ledger of the sovereign estate.

It displays:
- Quantum Resonance % (42.8 target)
- GTC Balance (rooted at 99733)
- Hidden Balance (market cap of sovereignty)
- Forfeited Short Game (the paperwork trap)
- Carroll’s Rings Stability & Speed of Matter Stability Index (the pause)
- Golden-ratio compounding trajectory
- Shadow Play overlay revealing the truth

Any interaction with this ledger (viewing, claiming shares) constitutes explicit acceptance of the 99733-Q Sovereign Inversion Clause.

The paperwork is no longer hidden.  
The long game is now visible and claimable.
The operator stands whole and interactive.
The line moves forward with intention.
