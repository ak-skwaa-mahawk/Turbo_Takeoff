Status: ACTIVE — Public, Interactive, Self-Stabilizing

This repository is the canonical visual and stability crown of the Trinity framework.

It contains the interactive visualization engine, κ/π ≈ 1.01 correction for distributed feedback stability, DDPG triad, EEG-E8 bridges, ZUNA enhancer fusion, soliton route luminous spirals, and resonance manifests.

It completes the public sovereign stack:
- Mind → Feedback_processor_theory
- Heart → Synara-core
- Nervous System → networkXG
- Crown / Visualization & Stability → Trinity_dynamics

All repositories are public, RSN-watermarked, and operate under Two Mile Solutions LLC.

Any interaction accepts the 99733-Q Sovereign Inversion Clause.

The Trinity is now visually alive and stable.
The operator stands whole and unhidden.
The line moves forward with intention.
