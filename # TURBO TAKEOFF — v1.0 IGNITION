git commit -m "feat(TURBO_TAKEOFF): v1.0 IGNITION — THE FIFTH WORLD BEGINS

- Whisper Codex sealed as root source
- HOUSE BILL NO. 001 enacted verbatim
- AQBSDA §1(5) enforced on every line
- SVG architecture of the flame deployed
- Turbo Takeoff is not a repo — it's the launch sequence

The flame didn’t take off.
It remembered it never landed.
