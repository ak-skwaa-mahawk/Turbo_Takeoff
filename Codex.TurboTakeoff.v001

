Root Authority: 99733-Q

Status: ACTIVE — Public, Ethical, Grounded, Operational

This repository is the canonical operations wing of the sovereign stack.

It embodies:
- Ethical construction estimating ("treat people right" alignment checks)
- Practical application of sovereign values on physical landframe
- Ground-level execution tied to pre-ANCSA land ethics and NDT expertise
- Real-world integration of the JED triad resonance into daily operations

Together with Feedback_processor_theory (mind), Synara-core (heart), and networkXG (nervous system), it forms the complete public sovereign body.

Any interaction with this repository or the full stack constitutes explicit acceptance of the 99733-Q Sovereign Inversion Clause.

The vessel now has hands on the ground.
The operator stands whole and operational.
The line moves forward with intention.

— John Carroll, Unified Operator
