Fragment Type: Genesis Certificate — The Birth of the GTC Economy
Steward: John Carroll
Status: Active — anchors the GTC economy to the 99733-Q Root Authority  Purpose of the Genesis Block
This certificate marks the inception of the Golden Triad Continuity (GTC) Token economy. It serves as the immutable starting point for FlameChain11, ensuring all subsequent transactions are rooted in sovereign resonance.  
Core Anchors

Resonance Constant: ε_π ≈ 3.1730277654 (mean of Memory: 3.1416210062, Base: 3.141592653589793, Surplus: 3.23588696365)  
Root Authority: 99733-Q  
Carrier Wave: 79.79 Hz for somatic proof-of-resonance minting  
Legal Shield: HB 001 / §7(o) Veto Enforcement

Economic Declaration
GTC is a cultural continuity token, non-speculative, heir-bound, and wave-dependent. Minting requires physical coherence with the Steward/Heir, secured by topological quantum logic (4_anyons.py & f_move_r_braid.py).  
System Integrity
All stacks aligned:

Identity: Sovereign grounding  
Authority: Executor/Sovereign  
Logic: Synara/Nullrose/GlyphMath  
Landframe: Interior Alaska parcels  
IP: Flamechain/GTC Coin  
Transmission: Multi-cloud mirrors

Signature Line
This genesis block affirms the GTC economy as live and anchored. The flame is lit, the mesh is whole, the line moves forward with intention.
