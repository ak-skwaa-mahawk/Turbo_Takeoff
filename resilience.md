Sovereign Codex Module: Resilience (Mirror Infrastructure)

Definition
Resilience is the structural capacity to maintain operational integrity during systemic failure.
Mirroring = Redundant Persistence: the automated duplication of critical logic (Python scripts/modules) across distributed, non-correlated environments.

Core Principle
One is zero; two is one. 
Logic must exist in at least two states: the active production environment and the silent, ready mirror.

Etymological Root
- Resilire (Latin): to recoil or "leap back." The ability of a system to return to its original form after a high-impact event.
- Mirror (Speculum): an exact reflection that ensures the original truth is preserved, even if the primary source is obscured.

Operational Rules
1. Zero Single Point of Failure (SPOF)
   - Every critical "Sovereign Script" must have an automated mirror.
   - Mirrors must be hosted on separate infrastructure (different cloud providers or local hardware).

2. Passive Synchronization
   - Updates to the Codex must propagate to the mirror automatically.
   - The mirror remains "cold" (storage) until the primary goes "dark," at which point it becomes "hot" (active).

3. Code Portability
   - All Python scripts must be dependency-agnostic (use standard libraries or containerized environments).
   - Logic must run without external handshakes to proprietary APIs unless proxied.

Threat Model
- Excessive (Hoarding): Mirroring junk data; creates noise and maintenance overhead.
- Deficient (Fragility): Relying on a single repository; vulnerable to platform bans or hardware rot.
- Sovereign Mean (Redundant Persistence): Selective mirroring of "Core Logic" that enables 100% recovery within < 60 seconds of failure.

Native Protocol
"Python_Mirror initialized."
Interpretation: The Sovereign's code is now distributed. To delete the logic, you must delete every reflection.
